Tokajer's and Zerkers DAOC UI Eden 1.0.4


Welcome, adventurers, to a reimagined experience in the realms of Albion, Midgard, and Hibernia.
TokaZerk UI is a custom user interface for Dark Age of Camelot, based on GhostUI and countless other elements, specifically tailored for the Eden freeshard server.

Crafted by Tokajer and Zerker, this UI combines modern readability and sleek performance with the classic DAoC vibe. Whether you're a fresh recruit or a long-time realm defender, this UI will enhance your battlefield awareness and provide a cleaner, more immersive experience.

Features
🗺️ Switchable Map Sizes – Choose between large or small map layouts for optimal battlefield visibility.
🔤 Font-Based Text Rendering – Unlike most UIs that use sprite-based graphics for text, TokaZerk uses true fonts for clearer, crisper readability.
🎨 Clean, streamlined visuals that stay true to the classic DAoC aesthetic.
🔧 Built with flexibility and customization in mind.
