## About the Project

Welcome, adventurers, to a reimagined experience in the realms of Albion, Midgard, and Hibernia.  
**TokaZerk UI** is a custom user interface for **Dark Age of Camelot**, based on GhostUI and countless other elements, specifically tailored for the **Eden freeshard** server.

Crafted by **Tokajer** and **Zerker**, this UI combines modern readability and sleek performance with the classic DAoC vibe. Whether you're a fresh recruit or a long-time realm defender, this UI will enhance your battlefield awareness and provide a cleaner, more immersive experience.

---

## Features

- 🗺️ **Switchable Map Sizes** – Choose between **large** or **small** map layouts for optimal battlefield visibility.
- 🔤 **Font-Based Text Rendering** – Unlike most UIs that use sprite-based graphics for text, TokaZerk uses true fonts for clearer, crisper readability.
- 🎨 Clean, streamlined visuals that stay true to the classic DAoC aesthetic.
- 🔧 Built with flexibility and customization in mind.

---

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Download and unzip the UI package.
2. Copy the entire `custom` folder to your DAoC UI directory. This is typically located at:


3. Launch DAoC and, on the **character selection screen**, go to:  
`Options > Interface > Custom Skin`  
Then select the custom UI.

---

## Usage

Once installed, jump into the game and enjoy the enhanced UI!

You can switch between **large** and **small** map styles by deleting the old `Maps` folder and renaming folders inside the `custom` directory:

- To use **large maps**, rename the folder `Maps_large` to `Maps`
- To use **small maps**, rename the folder `Maps_small` to `Maps`
